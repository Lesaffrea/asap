Note that many toxins appear! (Also, the length cutoff is important due to various very long viral polyproteins). (adding the "secreted" keyword criteria would remove only ~7 proteins from this)

    -> 894 sequences (pre filtering).

    FILTER:
    i)    "raw" sequences filtered internally (3 runs to 70% ID, minimum 10% length overlap):
        http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/result.cgi?JOBID=1442223776
        -> 437 sequences ("D3_all_70ID.fasta")

    ii)    Then filtered for max 40% ID similarity with the train set ("NeuroPred-UniqueNNames-sequences-65ID.fasta" - 238 sequences).
        http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/result.cgi?JOBID=1442224683
        ("Sequences in db2 that are not matched to db1"):
        ->  316 sequences ("D3_TEST.fasta")

    iii)
    Internal Clustering with CD-HIT (train vs train only) to 50%  gives:
    http://weizhongli-lab.org/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/result.cgi?JOBID=1442240233
    183 sequences. ("D3_TEST_50.fasta")

    iv)
    While I ran SCRATCH's ProfilePRO to generate PSSMs, (3 runs), errors occured.
    I split the files many times to track it down [and played with sequence filtering]. It's due to ("REP1_USTMA Q99109"), which has a "/" in it's descriptor-name. (This sequence was removed).
    I merged the resulting split files. [_A,B,C1,C22,C231 {contained the removal},C3 ]
        The ORDER of Fastas and PSSMs may be DIFFERENT After this!!

        >  174, ("D3_TEST_50_FILT.fasta")
        PSSMs were manually merged (A,B,C1,C22,C231,C3) into "D3_TEST_50_FILT.pssm"


    To get DISOrder preds:
        I manually changed all the fasta names, replacing "|" with "--". I run DisoPred (using "GetDiso.py") on this. I will then rename the sequences to their original name.
